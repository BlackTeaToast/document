EnSaaS-K8s-Service based on Kubernetes, but not only Kubernetes. It provides users with out-of-the-box microservice framework, enterprise-level container management platform, multi-level tenant workspace and consistent infrastructure encapsulation, providing full life cycle management for applications. This manual will guide you to use EnSaaS-K8s-Service from the following aspects: Application Management, Resource Management, User Management and Permission Management.

# 1. Application Management

## 1.1 Deploy applications

### Use a Helm chart to deploy applications

Helm 3 is used in clusters. So, when you use a Helm chart for application deployment, refer to the Helm 3 doc. For example:

```
$ helm install . --name dashbord --namespace dashbord
```
Upon deploying an application, management portal 4.0 gives each pod of the application five environment variables. For example:
![app](./image/app_5.png)

where

- datacenter: Name of the datacenter where the application exists.
- cluster: Name of the cluster where the application exists.
- workspace: Name of the workspace where the application exists. This name appears in the details section of the workspace; for example:

```
$ kubectl describe workspace 0875640d-a146-461c-bdbf-7bbd4de2de84
Name:         0875640d-a146-461c-bdbf-7bbd4de2de84
Namespace:
Labels:       name=rx-test1
```
* namespace: Name of the namespace where the application exists.
* appID: ID of the application. This ID is generated by management portal 4.0 and is unique.

## 1.2 Check routes

### List all routes

The page will list all the routes under a certain namespace:  
![ingress_list](./image/ingress_list.png)
Click link on "External Domain" field, it will transfer to the corresponding service index page

## Prerequisites

From EnSaaS-K8s-Service 4.0.6, user and resource management are mirgrated from SSO to MP4.0

## 3.1 Create user

1. Click the menu button on the top left-hand corner of the portal. Go to User->Resource Permissions. Click the "+" icon on the right:

![create_user](./image/create_user.png)

2. You can create new user while binding resource permission for him: 

![create_user_binding](./image/create_user_binding.png) 

**Note** If you don't bind resource permission for the new created user, you can refer "Bind resource permission for the new user" chapter

## 3.2 Bind resource permission for the new user

1. Click the menu button on the top left-hand corner of the portal. Go to User->Resource Permissions. Click the "+" icon on the right. At the new page, enter username in "Username" field, then move to "First name" field, then a dialog will popup:

# 4. Resource permission management

## Prerequisites

people's resource permission originate from two source:
- bind on the resource management page by other people, known as rolebinding permission
- inherited from the subscription, known as subscription permision

## 4.1 List user's resource permission

1. Click the menu button on the top left-hand corner of the portal. Go to User->Resource Permissions

2. On this page, we can search user by resource, such as cluster, workspace, namespace or by username

3. After you find the right user, move to  the three-point icon at the right and click. Now, the "Edit" icon is popup, click it, then you can see the resouce permission list at the bottom.

**Note**: The login user can only see the some-level and lower-level permission of the operated user.

2. After you find the right user, move to  the three-point icon at the right and click. Now, the "Edit" icon is popup, cli
ck it

3. Now you can see the resource permissions for this user. You can delete some permission here.

**Note**:
- for resource permission, lower-level permissions can be deleted
- for subscription permission, same-level and lower-level permissions can be deleted
- for permisson  inherited from subscription, can not be delete

# 5. The life cycle of clusters and workspaces

## 5.1 Life cycle of cluster

### Status of the cluster

Clusters have the following states:

- Active：Cluster can be used normally
- Inactive：The cluster is not available, the cluster data is reserved, and can be recovered within the validity period
- Stop：The cluster is not available, the cluster data is reserved, and can be recovered within the validity period

### What can be done to the cluster

- Subscribe cluster: after subscribing to a cluster successfully , the cluster status is active
- Unsubscribe cluster: after the cluster unsubscribes, the cluster status will change to inactive
  - After the cluster unsubscribes, if there is no renewal within 7 days, the cluster will be released automatically. Resources and data are not recoverable
  - After the cluster unsubscribes, the data and resources are reserved within 7 days, and can be restored to active after renewal.
- Renew cluster: after the cluster is unsubscribed and before it is released, you can renew the unsubscribed cluster. After the renewal, the status of the cluster is active
- Release cluster: after a cluster is released, all resources of the cluster will be released and the cluster data will be cleared.
- Upgrade cluster: you can upgrade the subscribed cluster, such as adding nodes to the cluster. The status of the cluster after upgrade is active

## 5.2 Life cycle of workspace

### State of the workspace

The workspace has the following states:

- Active：Workspace can be used normally
- Inactive：The workspace is not available, the workspace data is reserved, and can be recovered within the validity period
- Stop：The workspace is not available, the workspace data is reserved, and can be recovered within the validity period

### What can be done to the workspace

- Subscribe workspace : after subscribing to a workspace successfully , the workspace  status is active
- Unsubscribe workspace : after the workspace unsubscribes, the workspace status will change to inactive
  - After the workspace unsubscribes, if there is no renewal within 7 days, the workspace will be released automatically. Resources and data are not recoverable
  - After the workspace  unsubscribes, the data and resources are reserved within 7 days, and can be restored to active after renewal.
- Renew workspace : after the workspace  is unsubscribed and before it is released, you can renew the unsubscribed workspace . After the renewal, the status of the workspace is active
- Release workspace : after a workspace  is released, all resources of the workspace will be released and the workspace data will be cleared.
- Upgrade workspace : you can upgrade the subscribed workspace , The status of the workspace  after upgrade is active

- Stop workspace: after the workspace is stopped, the data of the workspace is reserved, and the status of the workspace is stop. After the workspace is stopped, it will not be operable, and all applications in the workspace will be stopped.
- Resume workspace: after resume a stopped workspace, the status of the workspace is active. Permissions and data for the workspace will return to normal.

Note: only for the dedicate cluster, the workspace created in the dedicate cluster supports stop and resume.

## User roles and their permissions

User roles in management portal 4.0 fall under the following categories:

Resources

- cluster owner
- workspace owner
- namespace developer

Subscriptions

- Subscription admin
- Subscription user

Operations

- datacenter admin
- cluster admin

1, Users with different resource permissions have the following roles for the Kubernetes native resources:
