​      Currently the subscription fees for WISE-PaaS/EnSaaS and related software services are charged at the end of each month, and we are going to adjust the charging date to the 1st day of the month starting 2020/08/01. Please refer to the following details:
- If the user makes a subscription to a service on 8/1, and the service is deployed and activated on 8/1, then the user will be charged for the month’s full subscription fee in WISE-Points on 8/1.
- If the user makes a subscription to a service on 8/10, and the service is deployed and activated on 8/11, then the user will be charged for the prorated fee, in WISE-Points, for the period of 8/11-8/31 on 8/11.
- Fees associated with service upgrades are calculated the same as above.
- Please expect up to a working day for the platform to complete the deployment and activation of a subscribed service.
- We will not refund points if the user decides to cancel or downgrade the subscription during the billing month. The request to cancel or downgrade the subscription will take effect the 1st day of the following month.
Services that incur fees based on usage metering are not affected by the above changes. These fees will still be charged according to the actual consumption in the following month.
